Data and code for the paper "Predicting Pelvis Impact Velocity Using Multiple Linear Regression from Experimental and Real-World Falls"

The excel file "Final_Pelvis_Impact_Velocity_Data.xlsx" is the dataset compiled from the 8 papers mentioned in the paper. Each paper has its own sheet in the notebook and each sheet has the following variables: Age (yrs), Sex (F/M), Body_Mass_Avg_Imput (kg), Height_Avg_Imput (m), Fall_Direction, Cause_Of_Fall, Activity_At_Time_Of_Fall, and Vertical_Velocity (m/s). Fall_Direction has three options: backward, forward, or sideways. Cause_Of_Fall has five options: hit/bump (B), leg collapse (C), incorrect transfer (IT), loss of support (LOS), or trip/stumble (T). Activity_At_Time_Of_Fall has four options: squatting (Q), standing (S), transferring from standing to sitting (T), or walking (W). The sheets "Hsiao & Robinovitch 1998 plot" and "Hsiao & Robinovitch 1998 plot 2" are not used as they were attempts to get pelvis impact velocities for each subject using the figures in Hsiao & Robinovitch 1998.
